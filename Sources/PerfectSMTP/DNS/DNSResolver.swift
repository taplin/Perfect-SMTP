//  DNSResolver.swift
//  PerfectSMTP
//
//  Plan §9 Phase 3 ("the single largest engineering item in the whole
//  plan"): a hand-rolled MX/A/AAAA resolver over NIO UDP, since no official
//  SSWG DNS resolver package exists. This is the public surface
//  `DirectMXTransport` (a separate, later piece of work, not built here)
//  consumes -- see each method's doc comment for the exact contract.
//
//  Scope, deliberately narrow (plan's explicit instruction): MX/A/AAAA
//  resolution only. Not a general-purpose DNS client -- no arbitrary record
//  type queries, no zone transfers, no DNSSEC validation (plan §9 Phase 4
//  owns the MTA-STS/DANE trust-policy layer; a validating resolver is a
//  distinct, larger concern explicitly flagged there as a likely
//  scope-narrowing candidate, not something this piece builds). Not the
//  retry-queue/circuit-breaker/multi-host-pool machinery either -- that is
//  `DirectMXTransport`'s job, built on top of what this file returns.
//
//  Query mechanics (UDP with randomized ID + ephemeral source port, timeout
//  + bounded retry, TCP fallback on a truncated response) live in
//  `DNSTransport.swift`; wire encoding/decoding lives in
//  `DNSWireFormat.swift` (pure `[UInt8]`, independently unit-testable with
//  no network or NIO channel involved). This file is the MX-specific
//  business logic layered on top: preference ordering + equal-preference
//  randomization (RFC 5321 §5.1), null-MX hard-fail (RFC 7505), and bounded
//  CNAME-chain following for address resolution (RFC 2181 §10.3 discourages
//  an MX target resolving through a CNAME, but real-world zones do it often
//  enough to matter for actual delivery).
