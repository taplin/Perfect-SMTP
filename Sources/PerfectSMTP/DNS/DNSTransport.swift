//  Plan §9 Phase 3, point 2: UDP query/response with timeout + retry, TCP
//  fallback on truncation. This is the only file in `Sources/PerfectSMTP/DNS`
//  that touches NIO -- `DNSWireFormat.swift` is pure `[UInt8]`,
//  `DNSResolver.swift`'s MX/CNAME logic is pure `DNSMessage`. Both bytes and
//  message decoding are unit-testable with no channel at all; this file is
//  what a fake-UDP/TCP-server integration test (`DNSTransportTests.swift`)
//  exercises.
//
//  Each query dials a **fresh** channel (UDP: bind ephemeral port 0, one
//  request/response, close; TCP: connect, one request/response, close) --
//  deliberately not pooled, unlike `SMTPConnectionPool`. A DNS query is a
//  one-shot request/response, not a multi-command conversation that
//  benefits from connection reuse, so this uses `NIOAsyncChannel.executeThenClose`
//  (the *documented*, request-scoped-lifetime way to use the async bridge --
//  see `SMTPConnection.swift`'s doc comment for why *that* type deliberately
//  deviates from `executeThenClose` for its own, differently-shaped,
//  pooled-connection use case; this file is the more conventional usage the
//  API was actually designed around).
//
//  Anti-spoofing hygiene (plan's explicit ask, "don't overengineer"):
//  binding UDP to port 0 gets an OS-assigned ephemeral source port for
//  free; every inbound datagram is checked against the nameserver address
//  actually queried before being considered at all, and every decoded
//  response's 16-bit transaction ID is checked against the query's
//  (randomly chosen per `DNSResolver.query`) ID before being accepted --
//  anything that fails either check is silently discarded and the wait
//  continues (bounded by the surrounding timeout), never treated as an
//  error in its own right, since an off-path attacker's forged packet (or
//  simply a stray/late reply to an earlier, already-abandoned attempt)
//  arriving is not itself a failure of the real query still in flight.
