//
//  Plan §3/§9 Phase 1: async-safe wrapper around `sendmail`/`postfix -t`
//  via `Foundation.Process`, for operators who already run a hardened MTA
//  on the same host. Delivery/retry/TLS from the point of handoff onward
//  is the local MTA's responsibility, not this library's — a
//  `DeliveryResult` from this transport reflects only "did the local MTA
//  accept the handoff," not per-recipient delivery.
//
//  Design notes called out explicitly by the plan, all addressed here:
//   - a single-resume guard bridging `Process.terminationHandler` to a
//     continuation (never resume twice);
//   - concurrent stdout/stderr draining to avoid a pipe-buffer deadlock (a
//     process that writes enough to stderr while only stdout is being
//     read, or vice versa, blocks forever without this);
//   - confinement behind an actor, since `Foundation.Process` is not
//     `Sendable`.
