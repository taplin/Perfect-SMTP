//  DKIMSigner.swift
//  PerfectSMTPCore
//
//  RFC 6376 (DKIM) + RFC 8463 (Ed25519-SHA256) signer -- see
//  Documentation/swift6-nio-rewrite-plan.md §4.6, this file's primary
//  spec, including the corrected oversigning-of-absent-headers semantics
//  (RFC 6376 §5.4/§8.15) and the RSA-2048 minimum.
//
//  Sendability note (plan §4.6's flagged open question -- "must be
//  verified before committing DKIMSigner to a plain Sendable struct"):
//  RESOLVED. Both `_RSA.Signing.PrivateKey` and `Curve25519.Signing.
//  PrivateKey` are confirmed genuinely `Sendable` (not `@unchecked`) in
//  the pinned swift-crypto 4.5.1, verified directly against the resolved
//  package source rather than assumed:
//    .build/checkouts/swift-crypto/Sources/CryptoExtras/RSA/RSA.swift:158
//      `public struct PrivateKey: Sendable { private var backing:
//      BackingPrivateKey ... }` -- unconditional `Sendable`, no
//      `@unchecked`.
//    .build/checkouts/swift-crypto/Sources/Crypto/Keys/EC/Ed25519Keys.swift:50
//      `public struct PrivateKey: ECPrivateKey, Sendable`.
//  So `DKIMSigner` is a plain `Sendable struct` holding key material
//  directly -- no actor or Sendable-box wrapper needed, the plan's
//  fallback path is not taken.
//
//  Placement/ordering invariant (plan §4.6, confirmed by the protocol
//  review, not re-litigated here): `sign(_:)` is the last transformation
//  before `SMTPMailer.composeAndSign` serializes the result into
//  `SignedMessage` -- nothing downstream re-encodes headers or body.
//  Wire-level dot-stuffing is applied later still, by the transport's DATA
//  writer (`SMTPConnection.sendBodyAndFinalize` -> `DotStuffing.encode`),
//  over these exact already-signed bytes; that's signature-preserving
//  because DKIM canonicalization operates on the logical message and
//  dot-stuffing is a wire-transparency mechanism the receiver reverses
//  before verification -- genuinely orthogonal, not a hazard, precisely
//  because nothing between here and the wire touches header or body bytes
//  again.
