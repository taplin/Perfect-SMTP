//
//  Real RFC 2047 encoded-words — this is Bug #2's actual fix (plan §4.7).
//  The old code emitted a fake, unescaped
//  `Subject: =?utf-8?Q?<raw>?=` for any subject that didn't happen to hit
//  the base64 branch. Two corrections called out explicitly by the
//  protocol review are implemented here:
//
//  (a) Folding at the 75-char-per-encoded-word limit happens on Unicode
//      scalar (character) boundaries only — a byte-oriented fold can cut a
//      multi-byte UTF-8 sequence in half, producing mojibake on decode.
//  (b) Encoded-words are never emitted inside an RFC 5322 quoted-string
//      (RFC 2047 §5 forbids it — a receiver that sees `"=?utf-8?B?…?="`
//      would treat it as literal text, not decode it). Non-ASCII phrases
//      are always emitted as bare encoded-words; ASCII-but-special-
//      character phrases use an ordinary quoted-string; never both on the
//      same phrase.
//
//  Milestone review finding (architect/protocol/security passes, all
//  independently converging on the same root cause): the CR/LF-stripping
//  sanitization here was originally applied only to Subject text and
//  display-name phrases (`sanitizeForHeader`, below), never extended to
//  the other caller-controlled strings that also end up embedded raw into
//  an RFC 5322 header line or an SMTP command line — reopening Bug #1
//  (the Bcc-header-leak bug) through addresses, `extraHeaders` names,
//  `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To`/`References`, MIME part `Content-Type`, and
//  the SMTP `MAIL FROM`/`RCPT TO` command lines. `rejectHeaderInjection`
//  below is the single, uniformly-applied discipline every one of those
//  call sites now routes through, instead of another set of scattered
//  per-field patches.
